### Hi there, Iâ€™m Gernot

I am an astrophysicist ðŸ”­ ðŸ”­ at [DESY](https://astroparticle-physics.desy.de) and [CTAO](https://www.cta-observatory.org). My main working fields are gamma-ray astronomy, high-energy emission from the direction of black holes or neutron stars, transient astrophysical sources, and the nature of dark matter. 

I am a specialist in simulations and reconstruction methods for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. I am also working in the framework of the National Research Data Infrastructure Germany (NFDI, [PUNCH4NFDI](https://www.punch4nfdi.de/)) on the implementation of FAIR data management workflows and archives in high-energy astronomy.

Much of my work is carried out as a member of the [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)](https://www.cta-observatory.org) Observatory and of the [VERITAS Collaboration](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu).
