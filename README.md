### Hi there, Iâ€™m Gernot

I am a astrophysicist ðŸ”­ ðŸ”­ at [DESY](https://astroparticle-physics.desy.de). My main working fields are gamma-ray astronomy, high-energy emission from the direction of black holes or neutron star, transient astrophysical sources, and the nature of dark matter. I am a specialist in simulations and reconstruction methods for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. Much of my work is carried out as a member of the [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)](https://www.cta-observatory.org) Observatory/Consortium and of the [VERITAS Collaboration](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu).
